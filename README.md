### Using/building/Å‚adeva
Usage pretty straightforward. just open&use.
```
$ bash build.sh
$ bash run.sh
```
### Sidenotes
So far this is somewhat incomplete project, we planning on making cross-platform one with mouse & genuine ANSI character support soon so you dont have to use WSL.
And yeah i know,much better tools for this but nohting will be quite like this. THis just powerful man.
